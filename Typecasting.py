# ---------- Type casting ----------

# Type casting is the means of converting the data type of a value to another one

# In this example we have 3 values x, y, and z which happen to be of different data types
# x happens to be a Integer, y is a float, and z is a String

#   x = 1 -- Integer
#   y = 2.0 -- Float
#   z = "3" -- Str
